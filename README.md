# StadiumSpectacleSimulation
Solution to my final year honours project for BEng (Computer Systems) at the University of Adelaide. Completed in 2011.
The Thesis folder contains the project report which details the problem description, design and final solution.
The StadiumSpectacleSimulation folder contains the simulation code. Note, the primary aim of this project was to come up with a prototype and explore the possibilities. As a result, code quality is a little wanting!
